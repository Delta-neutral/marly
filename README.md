# Marly
[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/marly.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/marly/)

A data integration platform that leverages language models for the movement of unstructured data. Our goal is to help you structure relevant data points from documents like a PDF, PPT or WRD doc from any source, compose it (provide a document like XSLX, PDF) and move it to any destination.

# How to Run
Install the Marly Python Package
```
pip install marly
```

---
Build the Platform from Source
```
docker-compose up --build
```

Try it out by running one of the example_scripts from the example_scripts folder :)
